Learning to use GitHub

This is the first time I'm using GitHub. 
I am doing so, because I recently joined the Eurobot team as part of the Imperial College Robtics Society (ICRS).
The goal of Eurobot is to make a robot that navigates a map and executes many complex tasks.
To make our workflow more efficient, we have decided to use GitHub as a platform to collaborate on our code.
